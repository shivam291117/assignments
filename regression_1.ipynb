        "\n",
        "**Definition:**\n",
        "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables in a multiple linear regression model are highly correlated, meaning they provide redundant information about the response variable. This can make it difficult to isolate the individual effect of each predictor on the response variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implications:**\n",
        "- **Unstable Estimates:** Coefficient estimates become highly sensitive to changes in the model.\n",
        "- **Reduced Interpretability:** It becomes difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.\n",
        "- **Inflated Standard Errors:** This leads to wider confidence intervals and may make it harder to detect significant predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Detection of Multicollinearity\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Correlation Matrix:**\n",
        "   - Compute the correlation coefficients between all pairs of predictor variables. High correlations (e.g., above 0.8 or 0.9) indicate potential multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):**\n",
        "   - VIF measures how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity.\n",
        "   - Calculate VIF for each predictor using:\n",
        "     \\[ \\text{VIF}(X_i) = \\frac{1}{1 - R_i^2} \\]\n",
        "     where \\( R_i^2 \\) is the coefficient of determination of a regression of \\( X_i \\) on all other predictors.\n",
        "   - A VIF value greater than 10 indicates high multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Tolerance:**\n",
        "   - Tolerance is the reciprocal of VIF:\n",
        "     \\[ \\text{Tolerance}(X_i) = 1 - R_i^2 \\]\n",
        "   - Low tolerance values (e.g., less than 0.1) indicate potential multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Addressing Multicollinearity\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Remove Highly Correlated Predictors:**\n",
        "   - Identify and remove one of the highly correlated predictors from the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Combine Predictors:**\n",
        "   - Combine correlated predictors into a single predictor through methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Regularization Techniques:**\n",
        "   - Use regularization methods like Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression, which add a penalty to the regression model to reduce the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Increase Sample Size:**\n",
        "   - If possible, increasing the sample size can help reduce the impact of multicollinearity by providing more information for the estimation process.\n",
