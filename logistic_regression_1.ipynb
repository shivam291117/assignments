        "**Linear Regression:**\n",
        "- Used for predicting continuous outcomes.\n",
        "- Models the relationship between independent variables and a continuous dependent variable.\n",
        "- Assumes a linear relationship between the variables.\n",
        "- Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Logistic Regression:**\n",
        "- Used for predicting categorical outcomes (binary or multinomial).\n",
        "- Models the probability of a categorical dependent variable based on independent variables.\n",
        "- Uses a logistic (sigmoid) function to map predictions to probabilities.\n",
        "- Example: Predicting whether a customer will buy a product (yes/no) based on features like age, income, and browsing history.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q2. What is the cost function used in logistic regression, and how is it optimized?\n",
        "The cost function used in logistic regression is the **log loss** (also known as binary cross-entropy for binary classification). It measures the performance of a classification model by penalizing incorrect classifications. The cost function is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[ J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} [y_i \\log(h_\\theta(x_i)) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - h_\\theta(x_i))] \\]\n",
        "\n",

        "Optimization is typically done using gradient descent or other optimization algorithms like L-BFGS.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
        "Regularization adds a penalty to the cost function to prevent overfitting by discouraging overly complex models with large coefficients. The two common types of regularization are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Adds the absolute value of coefficients to the cost function.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  \\[ J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} [y_i \\log(h_\\theta(x_i)) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - h_\\theta(x_i))] + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{n} |\\theta_j| \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "- **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Adds the square of the coefficients to the cost function.\n",

        "  \\[ J(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} [y_i \\log(h_\\theta(x_i)) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - h_\\theta(x_i))] + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\theta_j^2 \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Regularization helps in reducing overfitting by penalizing large coefficients, thus making the model simpler and more generalizable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q4. What is the ROC curve, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model?\n",
        "The **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve** is a graphical representation of a model's diagnostic ability. It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **True Positive Rate (TPR):** Proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model.\n",
        "- **False Positive Rate (FPR):** Proportion of actual negatives incorrectly identified as positives by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of the model's performance:\n",
        "- AUC = 1: Perfect model.\n",
        "- AUC = 0.5: Model performs no better than random chance.\n",
        "- AUC > 0.5: Model has some predictive power.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q5. What are some common techniques for feature selection in logistic regression? How do these techniques help improve the model's performance?\n",
        "- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Iteratively builds the model and eliminates the least significant features.\n",
        "- **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Shrinks some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a subset of features.\n",
        "- **Feature Importance from Tree-based Models:** Uses models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to rank features by importance.\n",
        "- **Correlation Analysis:** Removes highly correlated features to reduce multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "These techniques improve the model's performance by reducing overfitting, simplifying the model, and enhancing interpretability.\n",

        "### Q6. How can you handle imbalanced datasets in logistic regression? What are some strategies for dealing with class imbalance?\n",
        "- **Resampling Techniques:**\n",
        "  - **Oversampling the minority class (e.g., SMOTE):** Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.\n",
        "  - **Undersampling the majority class:** Reduces the number of samples in the majority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Algorithmic Approaches:**\n",
        "  - **Cost-sensitive learning:** Assigns a higher penalty to misclassifying the minority class.\n",
        "  - **Using ensemble methods:** Techniques like balanced random forests or boosting can handle class imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Augmentation:** Generates more data for the minority class through various data augmentation techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Evaluation Metrics:** Use metrics like Precision-Recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC that are more informative than accuracy for imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q7. Can you discuss some common issues and challenges that may arise when implementing logistic regression, and how they can be addressed? For example, what can be done if there is multicollinearity among the independent variables?\n",
