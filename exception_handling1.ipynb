        "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When Python encounters an error, it raises an exception, which interrupts the normal flow of the program. Exceptions can be caused by various issues, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or trying to perform an operation on incompatible data types.\n",

        "Detection: Detected at runtime.\n",
        "Handling: Can be handled using try and except blocks to prevent the program from crashing.\n",

        "Syntax Errors:\n",

        "Definition: Syntax errors are errors in the syntax of the code, which means the code is written in a way that violates the rules of the Python language.\n",
        "Detection: Detected at compile time, before the program is run.\n",
        "Handling: Cannot be handled using try and except blocks because they prevent the code from executing in the first place.\n",
