        "\n",
        "SQL databases are relational, with structured schemas and support for SQL querying. They are suitable for applications requiring complex queries and transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "NoSQL databases are non-relational, with flexible schemas and various data models. They excel in handling large-scale, distributed data and are more suitable for applications with dynamic or unstructured data needs."
