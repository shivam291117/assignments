REST is favored for its simplicity, statelessness, and use of standard HTTP methods and formats, making it ideal for most web-based applications and services. SOAP, while offering features like security and transaction support, is more complex, verbose, and less flexible, often used in scenarios where strict messaging and enterprise-level requirements are essential. Choosing between REST and SOAP depends on specific project requirements, scalability needs, and interoperability considerations."
