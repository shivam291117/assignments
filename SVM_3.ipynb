        "### Q1. Regression Metric for Predicting House Price\n",
        "\n",
        "For predicting house prices using an SVM regression model, the most appropriate regression metric to use is the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. This is because MAE provides a clear interpretation of the average error in the same units as the target variable, making it easier to understand the model's prediction accuracy in terms of actual house prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q2. Choosing Between MSE and R-squared for House Price Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "If your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** would be the more appropriate metric. MSE directly measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, thus emphasizing larger errors and providing a clear measure of prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3. Regression Metric for Dataset with Significant Outliers\n",
        "\n",
        "When dealing with a dataset that contains a significant number of outliers, the most appropriate regression metric to use is the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE, as it does not square the errors, thus providing a more robust measure of the average error in the presence of outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q4. Choosing Between MSE and RMSE for SVM with Polynomial Kernel\n",
        "\n",
        "If both MSE and RMSE values are very close, it is typically more informative to use **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**. RMSE is in the same units as the target variable (house price), making it easier to interpret. Additionally, RMSE tends to be more sensitive to larger errors, providing a clearer picture of the model's performance in terms of prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q5. Evaluation Metric for Comparing SVM Regression Models with Different Kernels\n",
        "\n",
        "If your goal is to measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable, the most appropriate metric to use is **R-squared**. R-squared provides a measure of how well the predicted values match the actual values, expressed as a proportion of the total variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It is particularly useful when comparing the performance of different models, as it gives a normalized measure of fit.\n",
